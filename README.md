Some of my favourite tips and tricks for cleaning data in excel 


##Cleaning Data##

=PROPER
=CLEAN
=TRIM
=LOWER
=UPPER

###Dates####

=Year
=Month
=Day
=weekday
=weeknum


###Splitting cells###

=LEFT(A2,5) - extracts the first five characters of the cell
=LEN(A2)-2 

Search and replace
=SUBSTITUTE(A2,"INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY","IT")
=EXACT(A2,B2) - COMPARES TO SEE IF IDENTICAL 

###IF STATEMENTS###

=IF(CRITERIA, TRUE, FALSE)
=IF(B2="",A2,C2) -If B2 is blank then True or False


=SUMIF(C2:C50, 

=MATCH
=INDEX
